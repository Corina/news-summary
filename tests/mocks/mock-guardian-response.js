          "body": "<p>It was a moment of casual ruthlessness outside a busy Glasgow supermarket seven years ago that lit the fuse under Britain’s most brutal gangland feud. Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll, a brutal enforcer for one of Scotland’s most notorious organised crime clans, was sitting in his car outside a superstore in the city’s north-east. What happened next will never be forgotten by the throngs of shoppers who witnessed it. Two men approached and fired several rounds into the car, killing Carroll outright in a gangland hit that had been carried out with cold precision.</p> <p>The intensity of the police investigation into the shooting of Carroll led to an initial period of calm in a tit-for-tat war that had raged through Glasgow’s hardest streets for 10 years. Its origins lie in the rivalry between two family gangs, the Lyons and the Daniels, for control of the city’s heroin and cocaine market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eaff1c6e7967937389a8aa02961bf83b4fb4c88e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaff1c6e7967937389a8aa02961bf83b4fb4c88e/229_0_1590_1987/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Carroll.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Carroll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Strathclyde police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past 18 months though, hostilities have been renewed with an intense ferocity that has led the Scottish government to intervene behind the scenes. There have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/16/police-confirm-shooting-st-georges-primary-school-glasgow\" title=\"\">daylight shootings</a> outside two primary schools in Glasgow at times of the day when children were being fetched by their parents. In another incident, the driver of a car was shot dead as he waited for the lights to change near a motorway junction.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Craig Gallagher, reputed to be on the opposite side of Carroll and his Daniels clan associates, was hunted down by unknown assailants to a derelict property in Lanarkshire. There he was believed to have been stabbed before being doused in petrol and set alight. He survived the attack because the building also caught fire and he was able to make his escape in the confusion. He then calmly drove himself to a nearby hospital and asked to be treated.</p> <p>Gerry Gallacher, a retired senior detective whose beat covered some of the city’s most dangerous neighbourhoods, has since spoken with police sources who were among the first on the scene. “There was a degree of admiration for the professionalism with which the execution of Gerbil had been carried out,” he said. “Nothing was left to chance.”</p> <p>Even by the ferocious standards of Glasgow’s crime clans, Carroll’s activities were notorious. He had a predilection for deploying power-tools and blow-torches in his day-to-day activity of enforcing the will of his boss, Jamie Daniels, head of the clan that bears the family name. According to Gallacher, he had simply carried out one too many attacks on Lyons’s personnel and thereafter his days were numbered. His fate was probably sealed after the Lyons clan received information that he had violated the grave of a young member of their family who had died in childhood. In 2015, William Paterson, 35, was jailed for life for Carroll’s murder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2887b2d7ddf30c9774b004578bacbc78ab6c46f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2887b2d7ddf30c9774b004578bacbc78ab6c46f6/51_180_1335_1668/800.jpg\" alt=\"William Patterson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Patterson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/police-scotland-told-to-pay-journalist-gerard-gallacher-10000-over-illegal-intercepts\" title=\"\">Gallacher</a>, who was a policeman for 25 years, is not surprised at reports of government intervention. “What troubles me about this latest round of incidents is the brazen aspect about them. They are happening in daylight and in built-up areas where children and families are present.”</p> <p>Another former detective said changes in police attitudes to informants have left the force at a disadvantage when dealing with this heightened level of gangland activity. “Individual detectives might spend years gaining the trust of an informant whom they might have managed to groom in exchange for a lighter sentence or early parole. Recently, we’ve been discouraged from getting too close to informants. They’ve been shared around a pool of officers, many of whom will have had no previous connection to the informant. This simply doesn’t work and undid years of knowledge about gangland activities.”</p> <p>And while surveillance techniques have increased in technical efficiency, so also have the crime clans’ ability to combat them. “Whenever a trial takes place of anyone accused of gangland activity, it’s like a university lecture for the families,” said Gallacher. “You can see them, taking notes in the public benches whenever there are details given in evidence of police techniques. They aren’t stupid.”</p> <p>The latest surge in gang-related violence has occurred at a time when Police Scotland is suffering a crisis of leadership. Last week it was revealed that the second highest ranked police officer in Scotland, Iain Livingstone, was also standing down amid reports that the entire senior police executive is set to move aside. Senior officers are also under investigation for illegal gathering of data against former police colleagues and a handful of investigative journalists.</p> <p>Despite billions spent over decades in relaunching Glasgow as a modern and sophisticated city of opportunity and leisure, it has never quite managed to shrug off its legacy of 1930s razor gangs, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Mean_City\" title=\"\">famously portrayed in the novel <em>No Mean City</em></a> by Alexander McArthur and H Kingsley Long. In the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/17/scotland\" title=\"\">Arthur Thompson</a>, feared and feted in equal measure and a former associate of the Kray twins, was the unchallenged master of the Glasgow underworld. The world he inhabited came to public prominence when his son, Arthur Jr, was gunned down outside his home. Days later, two young hoods, Joe “Bananas” Hanlon and Bobby Glover, were found shot dead in a car that had been dumped at a spot near where young Arthur’s cortege would pass later that morning. Since then, there have been sporadic outbursts of warfare including the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/18/ukcrime.kirstyscott\" title=\"\">ice-cream wars of the 80s</a>.</p> <p>It’s no coincidence that the crime gangs’ main centres of operation are among the UK’s most disadvantaged communities. The districts of Maryhill, Possilpark, Milton, Springburn and Barlanark form a belt of acute deprivation along Glasgow’s northern urban approaches. Their hearts once beat to the steady thrum of heavy industry and employment was plentiful. When a succession of postwar governments dismantled the industries, a void was all that remained in the absence of any long-term or sustainable replacement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c8d7ec37fff978a5ec9a7ee2fecb4cb8837fae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8d7ec37fff978a5ec9a7ee2fecb4cb8837fae6/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers of Strathclyde police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers of Strathclyde police with weapons seized from gang members.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Farrell/Strathclyde police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In these blasted terrains, the big and hard men offered leadership and a sense of purpose in the absence of anything similar being offered by governments. They offered affluence and status in exchange for unshakeable loyalty and generations of young men whose futures had been snatched away by mass unemployment were attracted by the opportunity to even up the score.</p> <p>John Carnochan was a detective chief superintendent in Strathclyde police and co-founded the world-renowned <a href=\"http://www.actiononviolence.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Violence Reduction Unit</a>. He has no doubt about the role that poverty and social disintegration plays in young men being attracted to this lifestyle. “You can trace a line of inequality through the communities that the crime gangs operate in,” he said. “If you are a young man who knows he has no future in work but everywhere sees evidence of grossly conspicuous consumption, then of course he wants some of that for himself.</p> <p>“And if he feels the state has denied him that, he can easily justify helping himself. Especially if he is given a sense of belonging and purpose to a cause he can belong to. These are attributes valued in public life and by governments. It’s time they started to ask themselves why young men in these communities are seeking it in crime. It’s time they got radical about tackling inequality in these communities. It’s about early intervention in very young lives to combat adverse early events.”</p> <p>It will not have gone unnoticed among Glasgow’s crime warlords that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/01/police-scotland-abandons-major-it-project\" title=\"\">Police Scotland</a> is in complete disarray. The violence won’t be stopping any time soon, nor will the laundering of the profits in all the usual outlets. The leadership and organisation of the family firms currently far outstrips anything that the forces of law and order possess.</p>"

He was last seen on CCTV in the early hours of 24 September walking into a horseshoe-shaped area – which is a bin loading bay – in Brentgovel Street.</p> <p>Police say compelling information points to the fact that Corrie was transported from the “horseshoe” area in a bin lorry. They say he had been known to go to sleep in rubbish on a night out.</p> <p>Urquhart, who is herself a police officer, said on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WhereisCorrie/\">Find Corrie Facebook page</a>: “This is their strongest line of enquiry and as such they are not looking at other possible lines or have dismissed them already as they so firmly believe Corrie is in the landfill.</p> <p>“Yesterday’s decision to stop searching at the landfill means they have now given up on finding Corrie. Suffolk police have handed back the landfill and are trying to have it filled back in this week.”</p> <p>“I am getting advice about the possibility about an injunction to stop them filling the landfill in at least until there is more honesty and plain speaking from the police.”</p> <p>She said she was angry at the claim her son slept in bins and did not believe there was any evidence he did. DS Katie Elliott said police had spoken to a witness who had previously found McKeague asleep in a bin and he had previously been found sleeping on park benches, in toilets and stairwells following nights out.</p> <p>Elliott said the police investigation has been continuing while the search was on. She said: “This has been an unprecedented search, in the scale and amount of waste that has been examined. We have searched the whole area where we believed Corrie could be. We had compelling information that directed us to this area however we haven’t found Corrie and this is bitterly disappointing.”</p> <p>The Milton landfill site covers some 48 hectares and accepts about 96,000 tonnes of waste annually. </p> <p>Elliott said: “The search has been complex, systematic, thorough and comprehensive. Throughout the process the work being completed has been reviewed by national experts.</p> <p>“The investigation behind the scenes hasn’t stood still while the search has been carried out, but all the information we have still points to the fact that Corrie was transported from the ‘horseshoe’ area in the bin lorry.”</p> <p>On the 38 Degrees website, Kelly Morris, who started the petition, said: “Corrie’s family and friends deserve to know if he is actually in there, after waiting weeks before starting the search, it is disgraceful that they would end the search without finding him but claiming he is in there. Why start a job if you are not going to complete it?”</p>"

They are also unhappy about the role of other councils in the assessment process.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Robert Kukaj, who set up a Facebook group allowing residents to voice their concerns, said: “The residents do not want to move in on the say-so of Camden council. There’s nothing in writing; everything is just in statements published on the council’s website. We’ve been living for years in an unsafe place, we want an independent professional body with no ties to local authorities to make an inspection.”</p> <p>Kukaj, 27, who lives on the fifth floor of Burnham, one of five tower blocks on the estate, said more than 100 residents were refusing to move back in over safety fears. </p> <p>Jayesh Kunwardia a partner at Hodge Jones and Allen solicitors, which is representing some of the Chalcots residents, said: “My clients have been told by Camden council that their hotel accommodation will no longer be paid for, and that they are to immediately move back into the Chalcot estate, where they will have to start paying rent again. They have been given no explanation about the work that the council has carried out or any evidence that the building is now safe to live in. I’ve written to the council to say that this is unacceptable and that until such evidence is given, my clients must remain in the temporary accommodation provided and paid for by the council.”</p> <p>The initial concern that led to last month’s evacuation was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/22/grenfell-tower-camden-council-to-remove-cladding-from-five-tower-blocks\">the similarity of the cladding to that on Grenfell Tower</a>. But LFB checks subsequently identified internal problems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/28/london-council-that-evacuated-building-knew-of-fire-door-problem-five-years-ago\">including with the fire doors</a>, 1,000 of which were ordered by the council in response. <em><br /></em></p> <p>While modifications have been made to existing fire doors, residents say they have been told new ones will be fitted at a later date. They also claim that with the focus switched to the fire doors, the cladding issue has been neglected.</p> <p>Hugh Roach, 31, who lives on the 17th floor of Bray, said: “There’s no talk of cladding any more. It’s the cladding that killed people in Grenfell. The fire doors are meant to give you half an hour [to leave the building in the event of a blaze] but the problem is if the cladding is flammable, it can still spread.”</p> <p>Roach said he had been told that his temporary accommodation would stop being paid for on Saturday but he would not be moving back until certain it was safe. “I don’t want to die of smoke inhalation lying in bed with my wife,” he said.</p> <p>Saranda Hajdari, 28, who lives on the 10th floor of the Burnham estate with her parents and five siblings, is also refusing to return. “Why are fire marshals here [they have been posted in every block until the work is complete] if it’s safe to move back?” she asked. “We have been told work will happen in the blocks over 18 months and phase two is work on cladding ... If cladding won’t be done in a year’s time then I don’t want to move back at all.” </p> <p>A spokesman referred the Guardian to several statements on the council’s website and said an independent review, likely to be published next month, would address many of the concerns.</p> <p>In an email to local MP Tulip Siddiq, who raised some of the residents’ concerns, the council leader, Georgia Gould, said the decision to evacuate the blocks followed LFB guidance. “We have followed their advice throughout this process and have only acted to begin assessing floors for reoccupation in conjunction with building control once the LFB had indicated they were assured as to our overall programme of works and our progress.”</p> <p>She added: “The overall cladding system at Chalcots has fire-stopping measures in place and the insulation material attached to the walls is Rockwool, which is non‐combustible.”</p> <p>This week Camden council <a href=\"https://jobs.localgov.co.uk/job/118306/director-of-resident-safety/\">posted an advert</a> for the newly created role of director of resident safety. The successful candidate will “assume accountability for the safety” of the homes the council provides to tenants and leaseholders. <br />The description of the new post, which has a salary of £100,000 a year, states: “You will be Camden council’s lead advocate on property safety, working closely with our residents to place them at the centre of our gold standard assurance work.”</p>"

The defence claims that the key evidence in the case, a bag containing a pipe bomb, a meat cleaver and shotgun shells, was planted in the lead defendant’s car by rogue undercover police officers.</p> <p>The case, which was originally scheduled to last two months but had faced continual delays, started summing up on Monday, with the jury expected to go out for deliberations next week. One of the issues they will be asked to decide on is whether the evidence of police officers was credible.</p> <p>Globe told the jury: “The information that had recently been given to me was that one amongst your number had said that DS Chambers was attractive, and another among you had then spoken to the court usher and on more than one occasion had asked the court usher to find out whether DS Chambers was single.”</p> <p>The information had originated from an inquiry by the Guardian relating to an overheard conversation.</p> <p>Globe continued: “The inquiries that I’ve conducted have led to one amongst your number telling me that that juror did find him attractive but had not expressed any interest in finding out whether he was single – but another juror had jokingly asked whether that was the case.</p> <p>“And although the juror who found DS Chambers attractive didn’t want an inquiry to be made of the usher, nonetheless, the other juror went ahead and asked.”</p> <p>No attempts had been made to seek further information about Chambers. The answers provided by the juror who was discharged were “really unsatisfactory”, Globe said. “She has not accepted that she tried to find out from the court usher on more than one occasion whether DS Chambers was single.”</p> <p>He reminded the court of their responsibility to consider the questions at stake “dispassionately, impartially” and without factoring in whether they found witnesses physically attractive. </p> <p>The juror who found Chambers attractive had impressed the judge with her direct answers to his inquiries, he said. Asked in a questionnaire whether she still felt she could act as a juror, she wrote: “Yes definitely!”</p> <p>Globe said he believed other members of the jury may have overheard questions being asked of the usher, and he reminded them that they had a duty to report any concerning behaviour among other jurors. “To put it mildly, I am disappointed that I was not given that information,” he said. “I’ve had to ask myself whether it isn’t so important that I shouldn’t allow you as a group to continue considering this case.”</p> <p>Naweed Ali, 29 and Khobaib Hussain, 25, from Birmingham, are on trial alongside Mohibur Rahman, 32, and Tahir Aziz, 38, for preparing terrorist acts between May and August 2016. They deny the charges. </p> <p>The case continues. </p>"
